<h1>Hi!</h1>
<h2>I'm S. M. V.</h2>
<h3>Welcome to my profile =)</h3>

I don't do much on here, in all honesty; I'm more active on Khan Academy...<br>I usually just use this as a bit of a dump XP<br>You can check out my KA profile <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_266891459920003908397632/projects">here</a> if ya wanna see some crappy PJS graphics, heh.

<em>In the meanwhile, here's a bit about me:</em>
- I just turned 14
- I like learning useless stuff...
- ...Like all 197 country flags =P
- I ~know JS, HTML, CSS, SQL, & PJS; I'm learning Python
- I ~know English, German, -----, Spanish, French, & Russian; I'm learning Italian while getting even more fluent in the others =P
- I live on Neptune ;)
- I'm from the capital of the southernmost state of the 196th least-populated country on Earth (-lol-)

If you want to talk to me for any reason at all, just hit me up in the Discussions on this repo =)
