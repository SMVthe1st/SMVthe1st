Hiya! I'm S. M. V., a 14-yo aspiring dev from Neptune. In all honesty, I don't know that much about programming, although I have a bit of experience in a multitude of languages. I love creating [graphics](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/MildlyAwkward/projects) (p5js, Vanilla JS [ctx], handcrafted SVGs, Figma, Canva) and front-end development, and I'm certainly hoping to learn more about back-end dev, too, :D. 

I also like wires, blowing things up, and motorcycles. 
<br>A lot. 
<br>Amongst others.

Oh, yeah.
<br>*****SIDE NOTE**: I AM **NOT** PINK. THAT'S THE RESULT OF A CARTOONISER, I just decided to roll with it, lol. It looks dope in [this](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFpjboj66Q/MBjJGFkPXNwvPiHemtGxIA/view?utm_content=DAFpjboj66Q&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink), tho >:)
<br><sub>Wait, maybe I _am_ pink...</sub>
<br><sub>Neptune!</sub>
