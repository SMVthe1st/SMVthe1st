- Hello, Iâ€™m S. M. V.!
- I like coding, music, art, and learning absolutely random stuff with no real-life value.
- I'm dabbling around in HTML/CSS, SQL, Python, and JS. But the only thing I'm somewhat good at... Is Processing, lol. Doesn't even count as knowing a language. I'm ehhhhh at HTML and CSS, and ehhhhh-er at SQL. 
- ...But I do know 5 irl languages, so there's that... XP
- I'm now 14 yo in grade 8.
- You can find me on Khan Academy (https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_266891459920003908397632/) under the same name of S. M. V. =)
- I have no clue how to use this.
- I need help.
- Nobody is gonna read this.
- I need a life.
- Bye!
