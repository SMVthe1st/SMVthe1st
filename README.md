- 'Ello, Iâ€™m S.M.V.!
- I like coding, music, art, and learning absolutely random stuff with no real-life value.
- Currently, I'm learning, or at least, *attempting* to, learn HTML and CSS.
- A day later... Now I'm kinda okay with HTML and CSS and tryin' to learn SQL and sucking at it.
- I'm now 14 yo in grade 8.
- You can find me on Khan Academy under the same name of S. M. V. =)
- I have no clue how to use this.
- I need help.
- Nobody is gonna read this.
- I need a life.
- Bye!
